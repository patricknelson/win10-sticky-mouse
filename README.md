# win10-sticky-mouse
Helps to circumvent the mouse sticking between multiple monitors in Windows 10. 

**What this does (and DOES NOT) do:**
* This WILL attempt to prevent the mouse from sticking in **corners** _in between_ monitors. 
* This WILL NOT prevent the mouse from being stuck between monitors when not near the edge (e.g. in the middle of the screen).  

## Bugs & Feature Requests:

Please [submit an issue](https://github.com/patricknelson/win10-sticky-mouse/issues) (check to make sure that your issue doesn't already exist here). If you can write code, pull requests are _very_ welcome!

Known issues:

* Pointer may stick (or bounce around a small amount) when moving very slowly.
* When entering a corner, pointer may come back out at lower/higher location.

## To Do
* Still need to complete vertical monitor mouse capturing (copy/abstract code from horizontal teleportation).
